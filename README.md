# Mentor Matching Project

A website for the Oregon State University EECS Community of Practice which will allow mentors and mentees to connect for an enhanced, in-depth learning experience.

## Development Environment Setup: VSCode

Clone or Download the repo then open the folder in VSCode.  
There are launch configurations for the NodeJS back end, the React fron tend, and an option for launching both simultaneously.  

React front end will auto-update when a front end file is changed, [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) can be used to do the same for the back end.

Necessary node module installation instructions:
npm install @google-cloud/datastore
npm install npm-run-all
